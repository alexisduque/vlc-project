abstract = "This paper introduces the asynchronous Optical Camera Communication (asynchronous OCC) using LED and rolling shutter camera as a pair of wireless communication. Aiming to enhance the capacity of unidirectional wireless link, the response of camera is measured, and then the operating frequency range, system architecture, decoding procedure and algorithm are proposed. The frame and super-frame structure are also considered especially for OCC using rolling shutter camera. The performance of implemented system is evaluated and discussed."

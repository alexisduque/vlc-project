abstract = "We present our efforts to design a communication system between an ordinary RGB light emitting diode and a smartphone. This work in progress presents our preliminary findings obtained investigating this poorly known and unusual channel. We give engineering insights on driving an RGB light emitting diode for camera communication and discuss remaining challenges. Finally, we propose possible solutions to cope with these issues that are blockers for a user ready implementation."

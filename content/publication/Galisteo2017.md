abstract = "We introduce the OpenVLC1.2 platform for research in Visible Light Communication (VLC) systems. The platform builds on top of previous versions, that has attracted dozens of users from the research community. We maintain its advantages such as the sup-port for communication with TCP/IP layers, software-based and programmable MAC and PHY layers, and low-cost front-end. In this new version, we make an effort to increase data rate and its overall performance. OpenVLC1.2 is available to the research community."

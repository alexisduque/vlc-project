abstract = "There has recently been a great deal of interest and research activity on the use of wireless visible light communication (VLC) systems. However, there is currently no widespread access to a common reference platform for VLC experiments. Researchers working with VLC must build their own local testbed to run experiments, even if they are only experimenting with VLC applications or protocols and do not intend to innovate in hardware. In this demo, we present an open-access VLC testbed as part of a larger, well-established wireless research testbed that is available to the community via remote access. We hope that this facility will enhance access to VLC for research and education."

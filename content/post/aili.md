At **Ubicomp'17**, Tianxing form Dartmouth College introduce **Aili**, a table lamp able to reconstruct a 3D hand skeleton in real time, requiring neither cameras nor on-body sensing devices thanks to VLC.

Aili consists of an LED panel in a lampshade and a few low-cost photodiodes embedded in the lamp base. 

This work brings out an original sensing application of VLC.

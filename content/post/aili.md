At **Ubicomp'17**, **Tianxing Li** form *Dartmouth College* introduce **Aili**, a table lamp able to reconstruct a 3D hand skeleton in real time, requiring neither cameras nor on-body sensing devices thanks to visible light.

Aili consists of an LED panel in a lampshade and a few low-cost photodiodes embedded in the lamp base. 
Aili reconstructs the 3D motion by sensing the panel light-beam obstruction by the hand. 

This work shows original application of VLC in the field of sensing. Use cases for smart-home, video games and entertainment are presented.

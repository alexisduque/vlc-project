This monday, during the **VLCS'17 Workshop** collocated with **Mobicom** at Snowbird, USA, *Ander Galisteo, Domenico Giustiniano (IMDEA Networks Institute, Madrid), and Hongjia Wu, Qing Wang, Diego Juara and Marco Zuniga (Delft University of Technology)*, unveiled the new version of the open-source VLC prototyping plateform OpenVLC presenting a poster.

They improve the plateform data-rate and performance thanks to new hardware (better photodetector, high-power LED circuit) and leveraging the Beaglebone Black Programmable Real-time Unit (PRU) to provide better timing and clock accuracy.

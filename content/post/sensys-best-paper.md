The paper ***SmartLight: Light-weight 3D Indoor Localization Using a Single LED Lamp, Liu, Song and He, Tian*** received the *Best Paper Awards* of the [**ACM Sensys**](http://sensys.acm.org/2017/) conference that took place in Delft, Netherlands from November 6th to 9th.

The authors introduce **SmartLight**, a novel approach of VLC based 3D indoor localization using a only one ceiling LED.
With a single modified LED lamp, the system is capable of localizing a large number of light sensors in a room.
They exploit the light splitting properties of convex lens to create an one-to-one mapping between
a location and the set of orthogonal digital light signals receivable at that location.
They conduct experimental evaluations with a 60hz projector showing that SmartLight achieves average localization around
10cm and 90 percentile error of 50cm.

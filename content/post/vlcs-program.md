<h4 class="page-header">4:50am - 6:00pm, Panel on "Hybrid VLC and Radio Communication: Potential, Challenges and Solutions for Coexistence"</h4>

<!--<p><b> </b><br>-->
<i>Visible light communication (VLC) has the potential for alleviating the radio wireless spectrum crunch problem that is evident with the exploding demand for mobile data communication through radio frequency (RF) technologies. While VLC presents a unique set of advantages over RF such as large unlicensed bandwidth, off-the-shelf hardware, yet, it suffers from fundamental limitations that are not evident or easily addressed in RF communication, such as the line-of-sight requirement, unidirectional communication, limited resilience to mobility and high energy budget. These complementary set of advantages and limitations present opportunities for VLC and RF communication to complement one another and coexist in next generation wireless communication systems. To understand the potential for VLC and RF technologies to complement and coexist as a hybrid technology, this panel will bring together experts radio and optical wireless communication to discuss the feasibility, the challenges and pointers for the community to realize VLC-RF hybrid wireless communication in next generation systems.</i><p></p>

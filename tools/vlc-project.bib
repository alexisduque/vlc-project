abstract = {Indoor localization has recently witnessed an increase in interest, due to the potential wide range of services it can provide by leveraging Internet of Things (IoT), and ubiquitous connectivity. Different techniques, wireless technologies and mechanisms have been proposed in the literature to provide indoor localization services in order to improve the services provided to the users. However, there is a lack of an up-to-date survey paper that incorporates some of the recently proposed accurate and reliable localization systems. In this paper, we aim to provide a detailed survey of different indoor localization techniques such as Angle of Arrival (AoA), Time of Flight (ToF), Return Time of Flight (RTOF), Received Signal Strength (RSS); based on technologies such as WiFi, Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID), Ultra Wideband (UWB), Bluetooth and systems that have been proposed in the literature. The paper primarily discusses localization and positioning of human users and their devices. We highlight the strengths of the existing systems proposed in the literature. In contrast with the existing surveys, we also evaluate different systems from the perspective of energy efficiency, availability, cost, reception range, latency, scalability and tracking accuracy. Rather than comparing the technologies or techniques, we compare the localization systems and summarize their working principle. We also discuss remaining challenges to accurate indoor localization.},

abstract = {The past decade's research in visible light positioning (VLP) has led to technologies with high location precision. However, existing VLP systems either require specialized LEDs which hinder large-scale deployment, or need cameras which preclude continuous localiza-tion because of high power consumption and short coverage. In this paper, we propose Pulsar, which uses a compact photodiode sen-sor, readily fit into a mobile device, to discriminate existing ceiling lights—either fluorescent lights or conventional LEDs—based on their intrinsic optical emission features. To overcome the photodi-ode's lack of spatial resolution, we design a novel sparse photogram-metry mechanism, which resolves the light source's angle-of-arrival, and triangulates the device's 3D location and even orientation. To facilitate ubiquitous deployment, we further develop a light regis-tration mechanism that automatically registers the ceiling lights' locations as landmarks on a building's floor map. Our experiments demonstrate that Pulsar can reliably achieve decimeter precision in both controlled environment and large-scale buildings.},

In this paper, we introduce LiShield, which automatically protects a physical scene against photographing, by illuminating it with smart LEDs flickering in specialized waveforms. We use a model-driven approach to optimize the waveform, so as to ensure protection against the (uncontrol-lable) cameras and potential image-processing based attacks. We have also designed mechanisms to unblock authorized cameras and enable graceful degradation under strong ambient light interference.

abstract = {For over one decade, research in visible light positioning has focused on using modulated LEDs as location landmarks. But the need for specialized LED fixtures, and the associated retrofitting cost, has been hindering the adoption of VLP. In this paper, we forgo this approach and design iLAMP to en-able reliable, high-precision VLP using conventional LEDs and fluorescent lamps inside today's buildings. Our key ob-servation is that these lamps intrinsically possess hidden vi-sual features, which are imperceptible to human eyes, but can be extracted by capturing and processing the lamps' images using a computational imaging framework. Simply using commodity smartphones' front cameras, our approach can identify lamps within a building with close to 100{\%} ac-curacy. Furthermore, we develop a geometrical model which combines the camera image with gyroscope/accelerometer output, to estimate a smartphone's 3D location and head-ing direction relative to each lamp landmark. Our field tests demonstrate a mean localization (heading) precision of 3 cm (2.6 •) and 90-percentile 3.5 cm (2.8 •), even if a single lamp falls in the camera's field of view.},

abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of light-to-camera communications for realizing applications such as localization, augmented reality and vehicle-to-vehicle communications. However, the fundamental requirement of visible light communications, flicker-free illumination, becomes a key limitation hindering existing technologies from serving a camera at larger distances. To break this limitation, this paper presents POLI, a light-to-camera communication system that exploits a novel POlarized Light Intensity modulation scheme to provide reliable communications for a wide range of distances. The key idea of POLI is to hide the information with the polarization direction of the light, to which human eyes are insensitive. Taking advantage of this, POLI can change the intensity of the polarized light as slowly as possible, at a rate determined by the range the system would support, but does not generate flickers. By using an optical component to "transform polarization directions to colors", POLI allows a camera to leverage its received RGB values as the three spatial dimensions to recover the information carried in different data streams. POLI further incorporates a number of designs to tackle the non-linearity effect of a camera, which is especially critical for an intensity-based modulation scheme. We implemented a prototype using the USRP N200 combined with off-the-shelf optical components. The experimental results show that POLI delivers to its camera receiver a throughput proportional to the dynamic channel conditions. The achievable throughput can be up to 71 bytes per second at short distances, while the service range can be up to 40 meters.},

abstract = {Existing visible light positioning (VLP) systems leverage the high image resolution of a receiving camera to support high positioning accuracy. However, power-hungry cameras might not always be applicable for many scenarios, such as smart factories, in which small objects require to be accurately localized and tracked. In this paper, we introduce CELLI, an indoor VLP system that only uses a single luminary as the transmitter and requires only a simple light sensor to achieve an extremely high accuracy with centimeter-level error. The key idea is to provide the spatial resolution capability from the transmitter instead of the receiver, so that the complexity of the receiver can be minimized. In particular, a small LCD is installed at the transmitter to project a large number of narrow and interference-free polarized light beams to different spatial cells. A receiving light sensor identifies its located cell by detecting the unique polarization-modulated signals projected to that cell. CELLI further incorporates a number of novel designs to overcome the technical challenges such as reducing the positioning latency, which is typically limited by the long optical response time of an LCD, and transforming a cell coordinate to the global 3D position using only a single light. We have prototyped our design using off-the-shelf optical and electrical components, and experimentally shown that CELLI achieves a median 3D positioning error less than 11.8 cm and a median 2D positioning error to less than 2.7 cm.},

However, existing visible light localization systems require customized light hardware, which increases deployment cost and hinders near term adoption. In this paper, we propose LiTell, a simple and robust localization scheme that employs unmodified fluorescent lights (FLs) as location landmarks and commodity smartphones as light sensors. LiTell builds on the key observation that each FL has an inherent characteristic frequency which can serve as a discriminative feature. It incorporates a set of sampling, signal amplification and camera optimization mechanisms, that enable a smartphone to capture the extremely weak and high frequency ( {\textgreater} 80 kHz) features. We have implemented LiTell as a real-time localization and navigation system on Android. Our experiments demonstrate LiTell's high reliability in discriminating different FLs, and its potential to achieve sub-meter location granularity. Our user study in a multi-storey office building, parking lot and grocery store further validates LiTell as an accurate, robust and ready-to-use indoor localization system.},

abstract = {Visible Light Communication (VLC) is an emerging technology in which Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) transport information wirelessly, using the visible light spectrum. While most of the research on VLC has focused on wideband white LEDs used in ambient illumination, narrowband and colored LEDs have received little attention. Short-range free-space optical communication based on narrowband LEDs as visible light transmitters and receivers enable a variety of applications, a scenario we refer as LED-to-LED communication. In this paper, we introduce the communication and networking protocols of LED-to-LED communication. Our work addresses fundamental challenges such as efficient collision detection medium access protocol and elimination of light flicker.We build a prototype and demonstrate bi-directional data exchange in a network of up to four LEDs. We further study the trade-offs in the system design and measure the achievable bit-rate and transmission distances.},

abstract = {Mobile phones can be used as mediators between users and interactive tabletops in several scenarios, including authentication and the sharing of information. Existing radio-based methods such as WiFi or Bluetooth offer a high-speed communication channel, but have serious limitations regarding the tabletop-phone-human interaction. They are not able to locate mobile phones placed on the surface, often require fairly complex coupling procedures for establishing connections, and are potentially vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks. In this paper, we present a method for establishing a bidirectional communication channel between mobile phones and vision-based interactive surfaces utilizing the built-in flash-light and camera of mobile phones and the screen and camera of vision-based tabletops. We establish an entirely visual, secure and bidirectional communication channel at a speed superior to previous vision-based approaches, enabling users to establish connections and transfer data to and from interactive surfaces using ordinary out-of-the-box hardware.},

COBRA encodes information into specially designed 2D color barcodes and streams them between screen and camera of smartphones. Due to the directionality and short range of visible light, COBRA can preserve user privacy and security in many near field communication scenarios such as opportunistic data exchange between smartphones. We develop a new 2D color barcode for COBRA that is optimized for streaming between small-size screen and low-speed camera of smartphones. COBRA adapts the size and layout of code blocks in streamed barcodes to deal with the significant image blur in mobile environments, and adopts new image processing techniques to achieve real-time barcode stream decoding. Our approach is evaluated through extensive experiments on Android smartphones.},

Described is a novel positioning technique based on transmitting signals with known sinusoidal components from a number of LEDs. The receiver uses the resultant optical signal at the receiver photodiode to calculate the receiver position. Proof of concept experiments show that white LEDs designed for indoor lighting can be used as the trans- mitters.

The basic idea is to leverage the existing lighting infrastructure and apply trilateration to localize any devices with light sensing capability (e.g., a smartphone), using LED lamps as anchors. Through the design of Epsilon, we identify and tackle several technique challenges. In particular, we establish and experimentally verify the optical channel model for localization. We adopt BFSK and channel hopping to enable reliable location beaconing from multiple, uncoordinated light sources over the shared optical medium. We handle realistic situations towards robust localization, for example, we exploit user involvement to resolve the ambiguity in case of insufficient LED anchors. We have implemented the Epsilon system and evaluated it with a small scale hardware testbed as well as moderate-size simulations. Experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of Epsilon: the 90th percentile accuracies are 0.4m, 0.7m and 0.8m for three typical office environments. Even in the extreme situation with a single light, the 90th percentile accuracy is 1.1m. We believe that visible light based localization is promising to significantly improve the positioning accuracy, despite few open problems in practice.},

abstract = {Recent literatures have demonstrated the feasibility and applicability of light-to-camera communications. They either use this new technology to realize specific applications, e.g., localization, by sending repetitive signal patterns, or consider non-line-of-sight scenarios. We however notice that line-of-sight light-to-camera communications has a great potential because it provides a natural way to enable visual association, i.e., visually associating the received information with the transmitter's identity. Such capability benefits broader applications, such as augmented reality, advertising, and driver assistance systems. Hence, this paper designs, implements, and evaluates RollingLight, a line-of-sight light-to-camera communication system that enables a light to talk to diverse off-the-shelf rolling shutter cameras. To boost the data rate and enhance reliability, RollingLight addresses the following practical challenges. First, its demodulation algorithm allows cameras with heterogeneous sampling rates to accurately decode high-order frequency modulation in real-time. Second, it incorporates a number of designs to resolve the issues caused by inherently unsynchronized light-to-camera channels. We have built a prototype of Rolling- Light with USRP-N200, and also implemented a real system with Arduino Mega 2560, both tested with a range of different camera receivers. We also implement a real iOS application to examine our real-time decoding capability. The experimental results show that, even to serve commodity cameras with a large variety of frame rates, RollingLight can still deliver a throughput of 11.32 bytes per second.

abstract = {The past decade's research in visible light positioning (VLP) has led to technologies with high location precision. However, existing VLP systems either require specialized LEDs which hinder large-scale deployment, or need cameras which preclude continuous localiza-tion because of high power consumption and short coverage. In this paper, we propose Pulsar, which uses a compact photodiode sen-sor, readily fit into a mobile device, to discriminate existing ceiling lights—either fluorescent lights or conventional LEDs—based on their intrinsic optical emission features. To overcome the photodi-ode's lack of spatial resolution, we design a novel sparse photogram-metry mechanism, which resolves the light source's angle-of-arrival, and triangulates the device's 3D location and even orientation. To facilitate ubiquitous deployment, we further develop a light regis-tration mechanism that automatically registers the ceiling lights' locations as landmarks on a building's floor map. Our experiments demonstrate that Pulsar can reliably achieve decimeter precision in both controlled environment and large-scale buildings.},

In this paper, we introduce LiShield, which automatically protects a physical scene against photographing, by illuminating it with smart LEDs flickering in specialized waveforms. We use a model-driven approach to optimize the waveform, so as to ensure protection against the (uncontrol-lable) cameras and potential image-processing based attacks. We have also designed mechanisms to unblock authorized cameras and enable graceful degradation under strong ambient light interference.

abstract = {For over one decade, research in visible light positioning has focused on using modulated LEDs as location landmarks. But the need for specialized LED fixtures, and the associated retrofitting cost, has been hindering the adoption of VLP. In this paper, we forgo this approach and design iLAMP to en-able reliable, high-precision VLP using conventional LEDs and fluorescent lamps inside today's buildings. Our key ob-servation is that these lamps intrinsically possess hidden vi-sual features, which are imperceptible to human eyes, but can be extracted by capturing and processing the lamps' images using a computational imaging framework. Simply using commodity smartphones' front cameras, our approach can identify lamps within a building with close to 100{\%} ac-curacy. Furthermore, we develop a geometrical model which combines the camera image with gyroscope/accelerometer output, to estimate a smartphone's 3D location and head-ing direction relative to each lamp landmark. Our field tests demonstrate a mean localization (heading) precision of 3 cm (2.6 •) and 90-percentile 3.5 cm (2.8 •), even if a single lamp falls in the camera's field of view.},

abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of light-to-camera communications for realizing applications such as localization, augmented reality and vehicle-to-vehicle communications. However, the fundamental requirement of visible light communications, flicker-free illumination, becomes a key limitation hindering existing technologies from serving a camera at larger distances. To break this limitation, this paper presents POLI, a light-to-camera communication system that exploits a novel POlarized Light Intensity modulation scheme to provide reliable communications for a wide range of distances. The key idea of POLI is to hide the information with the polarization direction of the light, to which human eyes are insensitive. Taking advantage of this, POLI can change the intensity of the polarized light as slowly as possible, at a rate determined by the range the system would support, but does not generate flickers. By using an optical component to "transform polarization directions to colors", POLI allows a camera to leverage its received RGB values as the three spatial dimensions to recover the information carried in different data streams. POLI further incorporates a number of designs to tackle the non-linearity effect of a camera, which is especially critical for an intensity-based modulation scheme. We implemented a prototype using the USRP N200 combined with off-the-shelf optical components. The experimental results show that POLI delivers to its camera receiver a throughput proportional to the dynamic channel conditions. The achievable throughput can be up to 71 bytes per second at short distances, while the service range can be up to 40 meters.},

abstract = {Existing visible light positioning (VLP) systems leverage the high image resolution of a receiving camera to support high positioning accuracy. However, power-hungry cameras might not always be applicable for many scenarios, such as smart factories, in which small objects require to be accurately localized and tracked. In this paper, we introduce CELLI, an indoor VLP system that only uses a single luminary as the transmitter and requires only a simple light sensor to achieve an extremely high accuracy with centimeter-level error. The key idea is to provide the spatial resolution capability from the transmitter instead of the receiver, so that the complexity of the receiver can be minimized. In particular, a small LCD is installed at the transmitter to project a large number of narrow and interference-free polarized light beams to different spatial cells. A receiving light sensor identifies its located cell by detecting the unique polarization-modulated signals projected to that cell. CELLI further incorporates a number of novel designs to overcome the technical challenges such as reducing the positioning latency, which is typically limited by the long optical response time of an LCD, and transforming a cell coordinate to the global 3D position using only a single light. We have prototyped our design using off-the-shelf optical and electrical components, and experimentally shown that CELLI achieves a median 3D positioning error less than 11.8 cm and a median 2D positioning error to less than 2.7 cm.},

abstract = {Accurate orientation information is the key in many applications, ranging from map reconstruction with crowdsourcing data, location data analytics, to accurate indoor localization. Many existing solutions rely on noisy magnetic and inertial sensor data, leading to limited accuracy, while others leverage multiple, dense anchor points to improve the accuracy, requiring significant deployment efforts. This paper presents LiCompass, the first system that enables a commodity camera to accurately estimate the object orientation using just a single optical anchor. Our key idea is to allow a camera to observe varying intensity level of polarized light when it is in different orientations and, hence, perform estimation directly from image pixel intensity. As the estimation relies only on pixel intensity, instead of the location of the anchor in an image, the system performs reliably at long distance, with low resolution images, and with large perspective distortion. LiCompass' core designs include an elaborate optical anchor design and a series of signal processing techniques based on trigonometric properties, which extend the range of orientation estimation to full 360 degrees. Our prototype evaluation shows that LiCompass produces very accurate estimates with median errors of merely 2.5 degrees at 5 meters and 7.4 degrees at 2.5 meters with an irradiance angle of 55 degrees.},

Additionally, it was officially standardized by IEEE 802.15.7 in 2011. However, it faces certain challenges that can be considered as grounds to develop a revised version. Optical camera communication (OCC) operates in the same channel band as VLC with more advantages on receiver characteristic and is a candidate for the standardization of issues in IEEE 802.15.7r1. Specifically, OCC presents a new and inexpensive technology that is different from other technologies such as radio frequency technology. Its advantages include the usage of built-in cameras in smart devices that can act as receivers for OCC. Existing lighting systems, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), liquid-crystal displays (LCDs), and digital signage, can operate as transmitters. This study provides an overview of extant research on the design and implementation of OCC. The analyses and discussions in the survey present relevant fields of implementation and future directions for OCC technology.},

abstract = {Despite the growing interest in Visible Light Communication (VLC), a reference networking platform based on commercial off-the-shelf components is not available yet. An open-source platform would lower the barriers to entry to VLC network research and help the VLC community gain momentum. We introduce OpenVLC, an open-source VLC research platform based on software-defined implementation. Built around a credit-card-sized embedded Linux platform with a simple opto-electronic transceiver front-end, OpenVLC offers a basic physical layer, a set of essential medium access primitives, as well as interoperability with Internet protocols. We investigate the performance of OpenVLC and show examples of how it can be used along with standard network diagnostics tools. Our software-defined implementation can currently reach throughput in the order of the basic rate of IEEE 802.15.7 standard. We discuss several techniques that researchers and engineers could introduce to improve the performance of OpenVLC and envision several directions that can benefit from OpenVLC by adopting it as a reference platform.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) envisions that many devices can connect to a network. Visible Light Communication (VLC) based on Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) is an attractive communication fabric for the IoT, as LEDs are readily available and can serve as transmitters as well as receivers. LED light bulbs, enhanced with photodiodes, provide an attractive path to extend device-to-device communication to room area networking. This paper describes a VLC system, called EnLighting, based on light bulbs that support an embedded Linux version (and its complete networking stack). These programmable light bulbs can both send and receive; they can communicate with objects in a room as well as with other light bulbs nearby. Bidirectional communication allows a light bulb to actively participate in networking and simplifies deployment, maintenance, configuration, and controllability of indoor lighting installations and services. EnLighting supports low-bandwidth communication services in a room (and via a gateway, beyond the room), which provide the base for other applications, e.g., a location service. This paper includes an initial evaluation of a room area communication and localization network based on prototype Linux-enabled light bulbs, reporting the performance for different network traffic types, and shows the benefits obtained from bidirectional communication. This proof-of- concept system illustrates that simple devices can provide an attractive solution to future communication challenges in the saturated radio spectrum.},

At the physical layer, we propose a novel transmitter design that allows information to be modulated onto very narrow light beams, projected to a large number of fine-grained{\}} locations simultaneously. More importantly, these light beams generate negligible interference to each other, as a result providing a high resolution for enabling accurate positioning.

LED-to-LED VLC adhoc networks are useful for combining a smart illumination with low-cost networking. We present and evaluate a software-based VLC physical layer and a VLC medium access control layer that retain the simplicity of the LED-to-LED approach. The design satisfies the requirement that LEDs should always be perceived as on with constant brightness. In each VLC device, in addition to an LED, only a low-cost microcontroller is required for handling the software-based communication protocol. The results of our performance measurements confirm recent claims about the potential of LED-to-LED VLC adhoc networks as a useful technology for sensor networks, smart and connected consumer devices, and the Internet-of-Things.},

abstract = {A novel near field communication system for smartphones based on visible light (NECAS) is presented in this paper. NECAS encodes information using combinations of different colors (red, green and blue) and their intensity levels of a smartphone screen, while the receiver captures the light signal via color sensors. In our scheme, a smartphone screen is segmented into four sub-blocks, and each of them can be used to encode information independently. NECAS can be used in a range of Near Field Communication applications such as contactless payments, electronic ticket checking and device paring. We design the color encoding scheme by experimentally profiling the interference of three color channels and the refresh rate of smartphones. We implement a joint decoding algorithm to deal with the significant interference among color channels. With a feedback channel, the retransmission scheme is adopted to improve communication reliability, and the system can dynamically adjust the number of combinations of different colors and intensity levels to fit the communication environment. Our design is validated via extensive experiments using a hardware implementation on Android smartphones and an Arduino platform. Index},

In this paper, we present a method for establishing a bidirectional communication channel between mobile phones and vision-based interactive surfaces utilizing the built-in flash-light and camera of mobile phones and the screen and camera of vision-based tabletops. We establish an entirely visual, secure and bidirectional communication channel at a speed superior to previous vision-based approaches, enabling users to establish connections and transfer data to and from interactive surfaces using ordinary out-of-the-box hardware.},

It can support a variety of novel applications such as aug- mented reality throughmobile devices, navigation using smart signs, fine-grained location specific advertisement etc. However, the achievable data rate in current LED- to-camera communication techniques remains very low (≈ 12 bytes per second) to support any practical appli- cation. In this paper, we present ColorBars, an LED-to- camera communication system that utilizes Color Shift Keying (CSK) to modulate data using different colors transmitted by the LED. It exploits the increasing pop- ularity of Tri LEDs (RGB) that can emit a wide range of colors. We show that commodity cameras can efficiently and accurately demodulate the color symbols. ColorBars ensures flicker-free and reliable communica- tion even in the presence of inter-frame loss and diver- sity of rolling shutter cameras. We implement ColorBars on embedded platformand evaluate it with Android and iOS smartphones as receivers. Our evaluation shows that ColorBars can achieve a data rate of 5.2 Kbps on Nexus 5 and 2.5 Kbps on iPhone 5S, which is significantly higher than previous approaches.},

abstract = {Visible light communication (VLC), a novel technology that enables standard Light-Emitting-Diodes (LEDs) to transmit data, is gaining significant attention. In the near future, this technology could enable devices containing LEDs-such as car lights, city lights, screens and home appliances-to form their own networks. VLC, however, is currently limited to point-to-point communication. To unleash VLC's full potential, we need to provide it with more sophisticated networking capabilities. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a novel platform aimed at distributed multi-hop visible light communication. Compared to the state-of-the-art, our platform provides similar data rates and coverage, but adds two unique characteristics: (i) 360° coverage, which is necessary to investigate an important property of LED communication: directionality, and (ii) a flexible design, which allows our platform to be connected to many experimental boards such as Arduino, Beagle bone, Raspberry Pi and sensor nodes. To quantify the communication capabilities of our board, we evaluate three key components: link quality, neighbor discovery and packet forwarding. Overall, we hope that our work will lower the entry barrier for members of the pervasive and networking communities to investigate and exploit future LED-based networks.},

Our software-defined implementation can currently reach throughput in the order of the basic rate of IEEE 802.15.7 standard. We discuss several techniques that researchers and engineers could introduce to improve the performance of OpenVLC and envision several directions that can benefit from OpenVLC by adopting it as a reference platform.},

We describe a low-complexity smart LED light bulb prototype that is based on existing consumer light bulbs and hence can be replicated without effort. The pro-tocol software employed for these smart light bulbs is con-sistent with earlier VLC protocols originally developed for communication between single LEDs. Using VLC with con-sumer light bulbs leads to improvements in communication range, field of view, and throughput compared to existing VLC communication systems based on single LEDs. VLC-enabled light bulbs are an important contribution to the vi-sion of all-optical networks, i.e., a multi-hop network of light bulbs in which light bulbs deployed inside buildings and communicate with each other using free space optics only.},

Described is a novel positioning technique based on transmitting signals with known sinusoidal components from a number of LEDs. The receiver uses the resultant optical signal at the receiver photodiode to calculate the receiver position. Proof of concept experiments show that white LEDs designed for indoor lighting can be used as the trans- mitters. The modulation bandwidth of white LEDs is large enough to give a range of localisation that is compatible with typical indoor applications. Introduction:},

abstract = {Exploiting the increasingly wide use of Light-emitting Diode (LED) lighting, in this paper, we study the problem of using visible LED lights for accurate localization. The basic idea is to leverage the existing lighting infrastructure and apply trilateration to localize any devices with light sensing capability (e.g., a smartphone), using LED lamps as anchors. Through the design of Epsilon, we identify and tackle several technique challenges. In particular, we establish and experimentally verify the optical channel model for localization. We adopt BFSK and channel hopping to enable reliable location beaconing from multiple, uncoordinated light sources over the shared optical medium. We handle realistic situations towards robust localization, for example, we exploit user involvement to resolve the ambiguity in case of insufficient LED anchors. We have implemented the Epsilon system and evaluated it with a small scale hardware testbed as well as moderate-size simulations. Experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of Epsilon: the 90th percentile accuracies are 0.4m, 0.7m and 0.8m for three typical office environments. Even in the extreme situation with a single light, the 90th percentile accuracy is 1.1m. We believe that visible light based localization is promising to significantly improve the positioning accuracy, despite few open problems in practice.},

abstract = {Recent literatures have demonstrated the feasibility and applicability of light-to-camera communications. They either use this new technology to realize specific applications, e.g., localization, by sending repetitive signal patterns, or consider non-line-of-sight scenarios. We however notice that line-of-sight light-to-camera communications has a great potential because it provides a natural way to enable visual association, i.e., visually associating the received information with the transmitter's identity. Such capability benefits broader applications, such as augmented reality, advertising, and driver assistance systems. Hence, this paper designs, implements, and evaluates RollingLight, a line-of-sight light-to-camera communication system that enables a light to talk to diverse off-the-shelf rolling shutter cameras. To boost the data rate and enhance reliability, RollingLight addresses the following practical challenges. First, its demodulation algorithm allows cameras with heterogeneous sampling rates to accurately decode high-order frequency modulation in real-time. Second, it incorporates a number of designs to resolve the issues caused by inherently unsynchronized light-to-camera channels. We have built a prototype of Rolling- Light with USRP-N200, and also implemented a real system with Arduino Mega 2560, both tested with a range of different camera receivers. We also implement a real iOS application to examine our real-time decoding capability. The experimental results show that, even to serve commodity cameras with a large variety of frame rates, RollingLight can still deliver a throughput of 11.32 bytes per second.

abstract = {Visible Light Positioning (VLP) provides a promising means to achieve indoor localization with sub-meter accuracy. We observe that the Visible Light Communication (VLC) methods in existing VLP systems rely on intensity-based modulation, and thus they re- quire a high pulse rate to prevent flickering. However, the high pulse rate adds an unnecessary and heavy burden to receiving de- vices. To eliminate this burden, we propose the polarization-based modulation, which is flicker-free, to enable a low pulse rate VLC. In this way, we make VLP light-weight enough even for resource- constrained wearable devices, e.g. smart glasses. Moreover, the polarization-based VLC can be applied to any illuminating light sources, thereby eliminating the dependency on LED. This paper presents the VLP system PIXEL, which realizes our idea. In PIXEL, we develop three techniques, each of which ad- dresses a design challenge: 1) a novel color-based modulation scheme to handle users' mobility, 2) an adaptive downsampling algorithm to tackle the uneven sampling problem of wearables' low-cost cam- era and 3) a computational optimization method for the positioning algorithm to enable real-time processing. We implement PIXEL's hardware using commodity components and develop a software program for both smartphone and Google glass. Our experiments based on the prototype show that PIXEL can provide accurate real- time VLP for wearables and smartphones with camera resolution as coarse as 60 pixel × 80 pixel and CPU frequency as low as 300MHz.},

With Visible Light Communication (VLC), LED light bulbs installed in a room can communicate with each other and other VLC devices (e.g., toys, wearables, clothing). The vision of the Internet of Things requires that light bulbs and VLC devices communicate via the Internet Protocol{\~{}}(IP). This paper explores how the IP stack and other networking protocols can be hosted on Linux-based VLC devices. The VLC link layer for Linux consists of a VLC network driver module on top of a previously developed VLC Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical (PHY) layers. The network driver provides the necessary interfaces to couple the IP networking protocols and the VLC layers. Performance and interaction between network driver and the existing MAC and PHY layers are analyzed and evaluated for different networking topologies and scenarios. The evaluation results suggest that the selected IP stack and the proposed VLC protocols are flexible enough to inter-operate.},

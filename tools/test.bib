abstract = {With the increasing consumer demand for smart objects, LED-to-Camera communication appears as a low-cost alternative to radio to make any conventional device smart. Since LEDs are already on most electronics devices, that is achieved at the cost of negligible hardware modifications. However, as these LEDs are very different from the widely studied ceiling ones, several challenges need to be addressed to make this happen. Among these issues, we note the constrained physical layer data unit (PHY-SDU) length that complicates the use of coding strategies to cope with bits or packets erasure. To break this limitation, this paper presents SeedLight, a coding scheme designed to face the inherent packet losses and enhance line-of-sight LED-to-Camera communication goodput. SeedLight leverages random linear coding to provide an efficient redundancy mechanism that works even on PHY-SDU of tens of bits. The key idea of SeedLight is to reduce the code overhead by replacing the usual coding coefficients by a seed. Since this work addresses IoT devices with low computational resources, SeedLight encoding algorithm complexity remains low. We develop an implementation of SeedLight on a low-cost MCU and a smartphone to evaluate both the communication and algorithmic performances. Experimental results show that SeedLight introduces a negligible overhead and can be implemented even on the cheapest MCU, such as the ones used in many IoT devices. The achievable goodput can be up to 2.5kbps, while the gain compared to a trivial retransmissions scheme is up to 100{\%}.},

abstract = {There has recently been a great deal of interest and research activity on the use of wireless visible light communication (VLC) systems. However, there is currently no widespread access to a common "reference" platform for VLC experiments. Researchers working with VLC must build their own local testbed to run experiments, even if they are only experimenting with VLC applications or protocols and do not intend to innovate in hardware. In this demo, we present an open-access VLC testbed as part of a larger, well-established wireless research testbed that is available to the community via remote access. We hope that this facility will enhance access to VLC for research and education.},

abstract = {We present the design of the first Visible Light Sensing (VLS) system that consumes only tens of $\mu$Ws of power to sense and communicate. Unlike most existing VLS systems, we require no modification to the existing light infrastructure since we use unmodulated light as a sensing medium. We achieve this by designing a novel mechanism that uses solar cells to achieve a sub-$\mu$W power consumption for sensing. Further, we devise an ultra-low power transmission mechanism that backscatters sensor readings and avoids the processing and computational overhead of existing sensor systems. Our initial results show the ability to detect and transmit hand gestures or presence of people up to distances of 330m at a peak power of $\mu$Ws. Further, we demonstrate that our system can operate in diverse light conditions (100 lx to 80 klx) where existing VLS designs fail due to saturation of the transimpedance amplifier (TIA).},

@inproceedings{Yang2017,
abstract = {Given the growing interests on using Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) devices to implement Visible Light Communication (VLC) systems, there is a call for filling the gap between VLC standards and practical deployments. In particular, since LED-Camera VLC systems have shown a strong potential in covering large indoor areas due to the increasing pervasiveness of LED lighting systems and smartphones, providing roaming support to such a system has become an impending need. To this end, we propose RoCLight as a lightweight solution to this call. In order to have a proper feedback channel for roaming support, we innovate in converting part of the LED luminaires (already used as the VLC transmitters) into light sensors. By sensing the disturbance to the ambient diffuse reflection caused by user presence and mobility, RoCLight is able to adaptively handoff its transmissions from one luminaire to another, so as to keep up with user mobility and hence to offer an adequate roaming support. We implement RoCLight as a small-scale testbed with five LED luminaires spanning a length of 7.5 meters, and we conduct various evaluations on the roaming support capability of RoCLight based on this testbed; all our experiment results strongly demonstrate its promising performance.},

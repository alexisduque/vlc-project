                   including authentication and the sharing of

                   increasing attentions in research, developing a
                   practical VLC system to harness its immediate
                   benefits using Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS)
                   devices is still an open issue. To this end, we
                   develop and deploy CeilingCast as a location-bound
                   wireless broadcast system using COTS LEDs as
                   transmitters and smartphone cameras as receivers.
                   CeilingCast innovates in its effective coding and
                   efficient decoding schemes, so that it can be fully
                   hosted in a smartphone and is feasible for all

                   of CeilingCast, in order to derive a model for such

                   vehicle for pervasive communication with mobile
                   devices. In this paper, we present a communication
                   scheme that enables interior ambient LED lighting
                   systems to send data to mobile devices using either
                   cameras or light sensors. By exploiting rolling
                   shutter camera sensors that are common on tablets,
                   laptops and smartphones, it is possible to detect
                   high-frequency changes in light intensity reflected
                   off of surfaces and in direct line-of-sight of the
                   camera. We present a demodulation approach that
                   allows smartphones to accurately detect frequencies
                   as high as 8kHz with 0.2kHz channel separation. In
                   order to avoid humanly perceivable flicker in the
                   lighting, our system operates at frequencies above
                   2kHz and compensates for the non-ideal frequency
                   response of standard LED drivers by adjusting the
                   light's duty-cycle. By modulating the PWM signal
                   commonly used to drive LED lighting systems, we are
                   able to encode data that can be used as localization
                   landmarks. We show through experiments how a binary
                   frequency shift keying modulation scheme can be used
                   to transmit data at 1.25 bytes per second (fast
                   enough to send an ID code) from up to 29 unique light
                   sources simultaneously in a single collision domain.
                   We also show how tags can demodulate the same signals
                   using a light sensor instead of a camera for
                   low-power applications.},

  abstract =      {Recent literatures have demonstrated the feasibility
                   and applicability of light-to-camera communications.
                   They either use this new technology to realize
                   specific applications, e.g., localization, by sending
                   repetitive signal patterns, or consider
                   non-line-of-sight scenarios. We however notice that
                   line-of-sight light-to-camera communications has a
                   great potential because it provides a natural way to
                   enable visual association, i.e., visually associating
                   the received information with the transmitter's
                   identity. Such capability benefits broader
                   applications, such as augmented reality, advertising,
                   and driver assistance systems. Hence, this paper
                   designs, implements, and evaluates RollingLight, a
                   line-of-sight light-to-camera communication system
                   that enables a light to talk to diverse off-the-shelf
                   rolling shutter cameras. To boost the data rate and
                   enhance reliability, RollingLight addresses the
                   following practical challenges. First, its
                   demodulation algorithm allows cameras with
                   heterogeneous sampling rates to accurately decode
                   high-order frequency modulation in real-time. Second,
                   it incorporates a number of designs to resolve the
                   issues caused by inherently unsynchronized
                   light-to-camera channels. We have built a prototype
                   of Rolling- Light with USRP-N200, and also
                   implemented a real system with Arduino Mega 2560,
                   both tested with a range of different camera
                   receivers. We also implement a real iOS application
                   to examine our real-time decoding capability. The
                   experimental results show that, even to serve
                   commodity cameras with a large variety of frame
                   rates, RollingLight can still deliver a throughput of

                   wireless transfer of data is often a cumbersome
                   process. We present a technique of associating a
                   mobile device to an interactive surface using a
                   combination of computer vision and Bluetooth
                   technologies. Users establish the connection of a
                   mobile device to the system by simply placing the
                   device on a table surface. When the computer vision
                   process detects a phone-like object on the surface,
                   the system follows a handshaking procedure using
                   Bluetooth and vision techniques to establish that the
                   phone on the surface and the wirelessly connected
                   phone are the same device. The connection is broken
                   simply by removing the device. Furthermore, the
                   vision-based handshaking procedure determines the
                   precise position of the device on the interactive
                   surface, thus permitting a variety of interactive
                   scenarios which rely on the presentation of graphics
                   co-located with the device. As an example, we present
                   a prototype interactive system which allows the
                   exchange of automatically downloaded photos by
                   selecting and dragging photos from one cameraphone

                   interesting applications in practical networking
                   systems. With network coding, intermediate nodes may
                   send out packets that are linear combinations of
                   previously received information. There are two main
                   benefits of this approach: potential throughput
                   improvements and a high degree of robustness.
                   Robustness translates into loss resilience and
                   facilitates the design of simple distributed
                   algorithms that perform well, even if decisions are
                   based only on partial information. This paper is an

                   network coding does and how it does it. We also

  abstract =      {Traditional approaches to reliably transmit
                   information over an error-prone network employ either
                   forward error correction (FEC) or retransmission
                   techniques. In this paper, we propose some network
                   coding schemes to reduce the number of broadcast
                   transmissions from one sender to multiple receivers.
                   The main idea is to allow the sender to combine and
                   retransmit the lost packets in a certain way so that
                   with one transmission, multiple receivers are able to
                   recover their own lost packets. For comparison, we
                   derive a few theoretical results on the bandwidth
                   efficiency of the proposed network coding and
                   traditional automatic repeat-request (ARQ) schemes.
                   Both simulations and theoretical analysis confirm the
                   advantages of the proposed network coding schemes

                   per-formance of random linear network coding for time
                   division duplexing channels proposed in [1]. In
                   particular, we study the case of a node broadcasting
                   to several receivers. We show that the effect of the
                   field size can be included in the transition
                   probabilities of the Markov chain model of the
                   system. Also, an improved upper bound on the mean
                   number of coded packets required to decode M original
                   data packets using random linear network coding is
                   presented. This bound shows that even if the field
                   size is 2, i.e. we perform XORs amongst randomly
                   selected packets from the pool of M original ones, we
                   will need on average at most M + 2 coded packets in
                   order to decode. Thus, there will be only a very
                   small degradation in performance if M is large. We
                   present numerical results showing that the mean
                   completion time of our scheme with a field size of 2
                   is close in performance to our scheme when we use
                   larger field sizes. We also show that as M increases,
                   the difference between using a field size of 2 and
                   larger field sizes decreases. Finally, we show that
                   we can get very close to the optimal performance with
                   small field sizes, e.g. a field size of 4 or 8, even
                   when M is not very large.},

  abstract =      {The optical antenna's directionality of nodes forming
                   a visible light communication (VLC) network, i.e.,
                   their field-of-view (FOV), varies greatly from device
                   to device. This encompasses wide FOVs of ambient
                   light infrastructure and directional FOVs of light
                   from low-end embedded devices. This variety of light
                   propagation can severely affect the transmission
                   reliability, despite pointing the devices to each
                   other may seem enough for a reliable communication.
                   The presence of interference among nodes with
                   different FOVs makes traditional access protocols in
                   VLC unreliable, and it also exacerbates the
                   hidden-node problem. In this paper, we propose a
                   carrier sensing multiple access/collision detection
                   and hidden avoidance (CSMA/CD-HA) medium access
                   control protocol for a network, where each node
                   solely uses one light-emitting diode to transmit and
                   receive data. The CSMA/CD-HA can enable in-band
                   intra-frame bidirectional transmission with just one
                   optical antenna. The key idea is to exploit the
                   intra-frame data symbols without the emission of
                   light to introduce an embedded communication channel.
                   This approach enables the transmission of additional
                   data while receiving in the same optical frequency
                   band, and it makes the communication robust to
                   different types of FOVs. We implement the CSMA/CD-HA
                   protocol in a software-defined embedded platform
                   running Linux, and evaluate its performance through
                   analysis and experiments. Results show that
                   collisions caused by hidden nodes can largely be
                   reduced, and our protocol can increase the saturation
                   throughput by nearly up to 50{\%} and 100{\%} under
                   the two- and four-node scenarios, respectively.},

  abstract =      {Due to the huge dependence of the users on their
                   smartphones and the huge technological advances in
                   their design, smartphones have replaced many
                   electronic devices nowadays. For that reason, it is
                   of great interest to use such phones to replace
                   magnetic cards. This paper uses the built-in Xenon
                   flashlight in today's Android smartphones to
                   experimentally transmit the data stored on the user
                   magnetic card to a card reader or automatic teller
                   machine (ATM). We experimentally modulate the
                   embedded Xenon flashlight in a smartphone with the
                   required information of a traditional magnetic card
                   and transmit the light over a secure high speed
                   optical link at 15 bps with no additional hardware at
                   the user end. The paper introduces the design of an
                   implemented small, inexpensive supplementary receiver
                   circuit module, which is easily attached to a
                   contemporary card reader or ATM machine. Furthermore,
                   the paper tests the system performance under the
                   effect of interference from another transmitter as
                   well as compares its speed and security to the
                   regular ATM card and to other competing
                   technologies.},

                   smartphones, smart payments and credit cards in most
                   daily tasks, it is a necessity to provide a secure,
                   easy and inexpensive way of communication between the
                   smartphone and automatic teller machines (ATM) or
                   card readers. In this paper, we have practically
                   implemented a system which replaces the magnetic card
                   with the built-in flashlight of an Android smartphone
                   to transmit the data stored on the magnetic strip to
                   a small, inexpensive module on the ATM. The
                   feasibility of the system is tested using two
                   different common types of smartphone flashlights: the
                   high brightness, low speed Xenon flashlight and the
                   comparably low brightness but faster light emitting
                   diode (LED) flashlight. The implemented system
                   succeeds in sending the required information
                   error-free at data rates of 15 bps and 500 bps using
                   Xenon and LED flashlight, respectively, over a short
                   distance light shielded channel. When tested in
                   outdoors or noisy conditions without light shield,
                   the higher brightness Xenon is more noise resistant
                   than LED. However, the system experienced challenges
                   due to the interference of ambient light especially
                   with larger distances between transmitter and
                   receiver and in too bright environments, proving the
                   necessity of a light shield.},
